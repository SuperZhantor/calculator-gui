---

## 2. Project Description

This project is designed to provide users with a simple desktop calculator for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

It uses **Python’s Tkinter library** to create a clean graphical interface where users can input numbers and operations and instantly see the results.

### What the application does:

* Performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
* Handles decimal inputs
* Provides error handling for syntax mistakes and division by zero
* Clear button to reset the calculator

### Why these technologies:

* **Python** for simplicity and readability
* **Tkinter** (built-in GUI library) for creating a lightweight desktop interface without external dependencies

### Challenges and future goals:

* Challenge: Managing input sequences to prevent invalid operations
* Future features:

  * Support for advanced operations like percentages, powers, and square roots
  * Keyboard input support
  * Improved GUI layout with modern styling
  * Dark mode option
